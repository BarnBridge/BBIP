## Simple summary

The synopsis of the improvement proposal. It needs to be short, clear and capture the essence of the proposal without going into any details. Provide an almost [ELI5](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ELI5) explanation.

## Abstract

A short (~200 word) description of the issue addressed.

## Specification

The technical specification should be detailed and should describe the syntax, semantics and interface of any feature. The specs should be detailed enough to allow technical discussions and ideation on top of this. 

## Implementation (optional)

The implementation can be added and updated before the **Frozen** state of the BBIP. It can be still be updated before that, even in the **Accepted** state.

This does not need to be the only implementation, but a canonical implementation is useful.
